# JME - jEAP Microservice Examples

Welcome to the **jEAP Microservice Examples (JME)**. JME provides a suite of example microservices designed to
demonstrate the development of [jEAP](https://github.com/jeap-admin-ch/jeap)-based microservices. Each JME repository
focuses on a specific jEAP functionality.

## Purpose

The jEAP microservice examples offer developers a collection of ready-to-run microservices that demonstrate best
practices for leveraging specific jEAP features. The examples address common challenges and cross-cutting concerns in
enterprise application development.

## Getting Started

The README of the [umbrella repository](https://github.com/jme-admin-ch/jme) provides guidance on the individual jEAP
microservice examples in the JME suite. Explore each example to see how specific jEAP functionalities can be
applied to your projects.
